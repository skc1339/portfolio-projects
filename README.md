# Portfolio Projects

This repository contains a curated collection of software development projects completed as part of coursework and independent practice.  

The projects demonstrate foundational skills in **C++**, **WebGL/JavaScript**, and **Android development with Kotlin**.

Each project is organized into its own folder with a dedicated README explaining functionality, technologies used, and how to run the project.
